	<h2 class="page-heading">Privacy Policy</h2>
	
	<p class="statement">Your privacy is critically important to us. At Retina we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>We don&#8217;t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can&#8217;t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
	<li>We don&#8217;t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
	<li>We don&#8217;t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
	<li>In our products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what&#8217;s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals: (Note, we&#8217;ve decided to make this privacy policy available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/">Creative Commons Sharealike</a> license, which means you&#8217;re more than welcome to steal it and repurpose it for your own use, just make sure to replace references to us with ones to you, and if you want we&#8217;d appreciate a link to Retina.com somewhere on your site. We spent a lot of money and time on the below, and other people shouldn&#8217;t need to do the same.)</p>
	<p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact admin@retina.net</p>

	<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
	<p>Like most website operators, Retina collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Retina&#8217;s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Retina&#8217;s visitors use its website. From time to time, Retina may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
	<p>Retina also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Retina only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>
	<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

	<p>Certain visitors to Retina’s websites choose to interact with
	Retina in ways that require Retina to gather personally-identifying
	information. The amount and type of information that Retina gathers
	depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors
	who sign up for an account to provide a username and email
	address. Those who engage in transactions with Retina – by purchasing
	access to the Akismet comment spam prevention service, for example –
	are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary
	the personal and financial information required to process those
	transactions. In each case, Retina collects such information only
	insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the
	visitor’s interaction with Retina. Retina does not disclose
	personally-identifying information other than as described below. And
	visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying
	information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in
	certain website-related activities.</p>

	<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>

	<p>Retina may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to
	its websites. For instance, Retina may monitor the most popular
	files on the site or use third-party services to help identify spam
	or abuse. Retina may display this information publicly or provide it
	to others. However, Retina does not disclose personally-identifying
	information other than as described below.</p>

	<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
	<p>Retina discloses potentially personally-identifying and
	personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
	contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
	information in order to process it on Retina’s behalf or to provide
	services available at Retina’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not
	to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and
	affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country;
	by using Retina’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such
	information to them. Retina will not rent or sell potentially
	personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to
	anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated
	organizations, as described above, Retina discloses potentially
	personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in
	response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or
	when Retina believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably
	necessary to protect the property or rights of Retina, third parties
	or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Retina
	website and have supplied your email address, Retina may occasionally
	send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your
	feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Retina
	and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to
	communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type
	of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a
	support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the
	right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your
	request or to help us support other users. Retina takes all measures
	reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use,
	alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
	personally-identifying information.</p>

	<h3>Cookies</h3>
	<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a
	visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the
	website each time the visitor returns. Retina uses cookies to help
	Retina identify and track visitors, their usage of Retina website, and
	their website access preferences. Retina visitors who do not wish to
	have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to
	refuse cookies before using Retina’s websites, with the drawback that
	certain features of Retina’s websites may not function properly
	without the aid of cookies.</p>
	<h3>Business Transfers</h3>
	<p>If Retina, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in
	the unlikely event that Retina goes out of business or enters
	bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is
	transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such
	transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Retina may continue to
	use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
	<h3>Ads</h3>
	<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by
	advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad
	server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online
	advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your
	computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things,
	deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most
	interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by
	Retina and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
	<h3>Comments</h3>
	<p>Comments and other content submitted to our Akismet anti-spam
	service are not saved on our servers unless they were marked as false
	positives, in which case we store them long enough to use them to
	improve the service to avoid future false positives.</p>
	<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>

	<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Retina may change its
	Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Retina’s sole
	discretion. Retina encourages visitors to frequently check this page
	for any changes to its Privacy Policy.Your continued use of this site
	after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your
	acceptance of such change.</p>
