Demand was very high for our badge, and we raised over $30,000 on Kickstarter to make this thing happen. We're giving you a second chance to get one on Tindie and beat the in-person sales rush @ DEF CON. You can watch our fun 1940's style video and see how we did right here:

Check out that Kickstarter!

When will you ship?
We will ship on approximately July 15th, giving plenty of time for badges to get to you before DEF CON 27. All of our parts are in and we are waiting for final manufacturing of our PCBs to take place at Macrofab in Texas.

What will the final product look like?
The pictures we have above are photos of our prototype badge. The final rendering, which is a red soldermask on matte black background, is what the final badge will look like. We will not be shipping red boards to you. Black only.

What is this thing?
If you're unfamiliar with electronic conference badges, they are usually some sort of printed circuit board badge that you wear on a lanyard. They're filled with puzzles, easter eggs, and all of cool toys that hackers love. They also act as a development and educational platform, encouraging people to learn about hardware development and manufacturing.

While DEFCON has their own official badge each year, #badgelife groups have been rolling their own badges to show off their skills in a sort of unofficial contest.

Badge Hardware
Our board is packed with features! It's a full computer, display, and sound system in a custom bomb-shaped board that's guaranteed to piss off the TSA on the way home.

A new micro controller, the Rigado BMD340 - 64MHz 32-bit ARM® Cortex™-M4F CPU with 1MB Flash & 256kB RAM
650mA LDO (3.3v) and charging system
Complete Bluetooth 5.0 and Thread (802.15.4) solution, for badge-to-badge battles!
ChibiOS real-time operating system
24bit/96Khz STEREO Audio driven by the CS4344 DAC and LM4880 200mW Stereo amplifier.
Two 87dB Speakers (not shown in the current prototype, that's what those wires are for hanging off the board. We're not done, ok?!)
320x240 detachable TFT touch screen with Micro-SD port
4GB MicroSD card containing our game code
CP2102 UART - Low cost USB Interface
JTAG (SWD) programming interface

Seven tactile 4.2mm buttons arranged in a Joypad with A/B/Enter buttons
2000 mAh LiPo battery with full MAX73833 1 Amp USB Charging circuit
(no more searching all of Vegas for batteries during the con!)

Dual Joysticks with 5 inputs each!
Badge Functions
Many LED pattern modes. Such blinky, so wow.
LED Dimming so it doesn't blind you.
Badge to Badge Sea warfare/bombing game with multiple levels and RPG-like attributes. Level up and battle your friends!
Video playback with synchronized audio (We're seeing around 18 FPS right now on the new code!)
Digital Audio playback, audio amplifier, and speaker.
SECRET STUFF
All specifications subject to change at any time based on market/part availability
What makes our badge different?
This is a lightweight system with a long battery life, and the battery itself is rechargeable! You don't have to run around the conference trying to find AA batteries or other strange and rare camera batteries, which many badges run on.

What's this game all about? Why a Sea Battle?
We really liked watching people battle each other at DC25. We want to keep that going and thought that a Sea Battle game might be fun, based on your votes on our Twitter account.

The game is full color, with animation, and has been developed by our game designer, Egan, who worked on many AAA game releases. John's writing the software, Bill has done extensive work to bring the board and drivers to life.

Other software?
The board will also have easter eggs, a crypto puzzle, radio chat system, setup screen, and more. If you access the console via FTDI/USB you might find some more things to play with, but we'll keep that a secret for now!
